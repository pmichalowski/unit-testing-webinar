# Angular Unit Testing Webinar Playground

This is a basic Angular project with a couple of minor adjustments:
- I've added a `test-coverage` npm script, so you could do a single-run of tests which generates the coverage report in `/coverage` folder
- I've excluded the `*.stub.ts` files from code coverage reports in `angular.json`

## How to use it?
Run `npm run test` and have fun - try to change the something to see where the tests will break, try to add more functionalities and add coverage for them etc. Play and learn :)
